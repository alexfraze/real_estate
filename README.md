# real_estate

Im a data scientist / ML engineer and I want to buy my first house in the next year or so.
I figured it would be a good idea to do some data analysis into what potential area would be the best place to buy.
My goal is to try and factor in a few major criteria:

1. Appreciation over the next 10-20 years
2. Rental Yields over the next 10-20 years
3. Population/Income growth of the area
